## User Story
As a social media startup, I want an api for my social network that uses a NoSQL database. So that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Description
* You will need to use insomnia for this application. When the server starts, the mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. You can use get routes to get users and thoughs data. POST, PUT and DELETE routes are also available for adding friends to a user, adding reactions to a post and or deleting them.
